# LinkedList

i've just talked a lot about how the linkedList, and the ArrayList, are different under the covers. an ArrayList is implemented on top of an array but a linkedList ia a doubly linkedList. Both implement all oj list;s methods, but the linked list. Both implements all of the list's methods, but linked list also implements the Queue and Stack methods as well.

#A Queue is a First-in, first-out Data Collection

When you thinks of a queue, you might think od standing in line. When you get in a line or a queue, you expect that you'll be processed, in relationship to the first person in line. we call this a first-in first-out, 

if you want ro remove an item, you poll the queue, getting the first element or person in the line. if tou want to add an item you offer it onto the queue sending it to the back of the line. single-ended queues always process elements from the star of the queue. 

a double-ended queue allows access to both the start and end of the queue. a LinkedList can be used as a double ended queue.
