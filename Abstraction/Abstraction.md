## Generalization and Abstraction 
 we use terms abstraction and Generalization we start trying to model real world things in software. before i launch into interface types and abstract classes, i want to talk about what these concepts mean.

 When you start modeling objects for your application, you start by identifying what features and behaviors your object have in common. we generalize when we create a class hierarchy. a base class is the most general class, the most basic building block, which everything can be said to have in common
